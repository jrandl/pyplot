### Matplotlib and Pyplot Exercises
This repository contains a series of exercises focused on data visualization using Matplotlib and Pyplot in Python. The tasks are designed to enhance your understanding of plotting various types of data and customizing plots for better presentation.

### Project Overview
You will work through a Python Notebook that includes several plotting tasks:

### Character Frequency Bar Plot:
 Create a bar plot showing the frequency distribution of characters in a given text.
### Random Number Visualization:
Generate random numbers and visualize them using scatter and line plots.
### Styled Plots: 
Customize the style and color of scatter and line plots.
### Algorithm Performance Comparison: 
Plot the execution times of different sorting algorithms on the same axes with appropriate legends.
